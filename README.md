About the Project

Traditional attendance systems are time-consuming and error-prone. This project demonstrates how an ESP32 microcontroller can be used to record attendance digitally and efficiently. The system captures attendance data and transmits or stores it for further processing.

This repository focuses on:
	•	ESP32 programming
	•	Embedded systems basics
	•	Hardware–software integration
	•	IoT fundamentals

How It Works
	1.	ESP32 initializes and waits for input
	2.	Attendance data is captured
	3.	Data is processed by ESP32
	4.	Attendance is sent via Serial or Wi-Fi
	5.	Records can be viewed or stored externally

⸻

Setup Instructions
	1.	Install Arduino IDE
	2.	Add ESP32 board support in Board Manager
	3.	Connect ESP32 via USB
	4.	Select correct COM port and board
	5.	Upload the code
	6.	Open Serial Monitor to view attendance logs

⸻

Testing
	•	Verify ESP32 power and connection
	•	Check serial output
	•	Validate attendance data accuracy

⸻

Applications
	•	College attendance system
	•	Lab access monitoring
