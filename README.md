# RFID-based-attendence-system
This IoT-based attendance system uses an ESP32 and RC522 RFID reader to automate check-ins. It captures unique card UIDs and transmits data over Wi-Fi to a real-time database. Designed for schools or offices, it eliminates manual logs, reduces errors, and offers a scalable solution for modern, contactless attendance management.
